## The Principle of S.O.L.I.D

These five software development principles are guidelines to follow when building software so that it is easier to scale and maintain. They were made popular by a software engineer, Robert C. Martin.

SOLID principles must be applied to obtain the benefits of object orientation, such as:

* Be easy to maintain, adapt and adjust to scope changes;
* Be testable and easy to understand;
* Be extensible for changes with the least amount of effort required;
* Provides maximum reuse;
* To remain in use as long as possible.

SOLID Principles

```
 S — Single Responsibility
 A class should have a single responsibility

</p>

```
 O — Open-Closed
 Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification

</p>

```
 L — Liskov Substitution
 If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

</p>

```
I — Interface Segregation
 Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

</p>

```
 D — Dependency Inversion
 - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
 - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
